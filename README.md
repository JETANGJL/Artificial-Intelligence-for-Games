## 🌳 Assignment 1: Tree
- Built a generic tree structure with serialization, traversal (DFS, BFS), and pathfinding.

## 🟦 Assignment 2: Flood Fill
- Recursive & iterative flood fill algorithms for grid exploration and region marking.

## 🌲 Assignment 3: Tree + Flood Fill
- Combined tree structures with flood fill logic for hierarchical map analysis.

## 🧭 Assignment 4: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Implemented shortest path finding on weighted graphs.
- Compared against BFS and A* for efficiency.

## 📡 Assignment 5: Bellman-Ford
- Shortest path algorithm supporting negative weights.
- Includes relaxation tracking.

## 🔄 Assignment 8: Backtracking
- Solved Sudoku puzzles using backtracking search.
- Demonstrates constraint satisfaction techniques.

## ♟️ Assignment 9: Adversarial Search
- Implemented Minimax & Alpha-Beta pruning for Tic-Tac-Toe.

## 🌳 Assignment 10: Behavior Trees
- Built Behavior Tree agents with reusable task, selector, and sequence nodes.

## 🔮 Assignment 11: Fuzzy Logic
- Implemented fuzzy sets with membership functions.
- Applied for decision-making based on uncertainty.

## 🧬 Assignment 12: Genetic Algorithm
- Developed GA framework with selection, crossover, mutation.
- Applied to 8-Queens and optimization problems.
